Hi! My name is Rachel McCombs, and I'm a sophomore at UNC Wilmington majoring in Oceanography with a minor in Environmental Science. I'm very excited to be able to work with Dr. Bresnahan in the COAST Lab.

I'm from Clayton, North Carolina and have always loved taking trips to the beach with my family. I grew up wanting to be a marine biologist because of how much I loved to go fishing with my dad and taking many summer camps learning about marine biology. I got my scuba diving certification through NAUI at Coastal Studies Institute when I was 13 years old and since then I knew I wanted to take this interest for the ocean further. 

Some other interest and hobbies of mine outside of school are going to the gym, baking things like sourdough bread and more, reading, traveling, and Color Guard. In highschool I was a part of the Color Guard team and competed at many National competitions. I carried this passion over into college and now teach at a local high school. I also love the outdoors and enjoy camping, hiking and taking my paddle board out. 

Thanks for getting to know a little about me!
